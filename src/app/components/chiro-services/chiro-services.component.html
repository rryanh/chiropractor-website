        <h2 class="heading-tertiary">Chiropractic Adjustment</h2>

        <p class="service-info">
          The chiropractor will either adjust or mobilize the joints at the end

        <h2 class="heading-tertiary">Soft Tissue Release</h2>

        <p class="service-info">
          Kelowna chiropractors perform soft tissue massage techniques prior to
          their adjustments to warm up the musculature before any joint
          alignment. This technique allows for better alignment and longer
          lasting results.

        <h2 class="heading-tertiary">Graston Technique</h2>

        <p class="service-info">
          This modality is a soft tissue mobilization that helps break down
          adhesions present in your musculoskeletal system. Once the adhesions
          are broken down, new strong soft tissue starts to build where there
          were calcifications and scar tissue.

        <h2 class="heading-tertiary">Cupping</h2>

        <p class="service-info">
          Used as a soft tissue modality, our chiropractors use cupping to
          reduce pain and relieve stress & tension for patients. It lifts the
          skin and underlying connective tissues to increase blood flow to the
          treated area. It is a great treatment for stiff and sore muscles.

        <p class="service-info">
          These programs can improve a patientâ€™s quality of life by reinforcing
          correct movement patterns, and increasing overall strength. They are
          tailored rehab plans based on your injury, so you can help yourself at
          home between chiropractic treatments.
